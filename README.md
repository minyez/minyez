I am currently a PhD candidate at Institute of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University, under the supervision of Professor Hong Jiang.

My researches focus on the applications of many-body perturbation techniques in material systems for physical properties such as phase stability and electronic structure. I am also involved in the methodological developments on accuracy and efficiency of an all-electron GW code.
